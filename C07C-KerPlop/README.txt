Davita Bird and Kai Hoshijo Section B

We have 5 interacting pieces: Archer, Health Potion, Homicidal Plant, Lich and Trophy. We also have one piece for each interaction result. The Lich will kill the player, the Health Potion will advance the player, the Homicidal Plant will do nothing, The Trophy returns Get_Point, and the Archer returns Hit.
Both the Archer and the Lich interact at a distance. The Homicidal Plant, Health Potion and Trophy interact only when on the same square as the player.
The Lich moves randomly about the board and the Archer moves one box towards the player on the board.
The Bush is only drawable and is not a GamePiece and thus has no InteractionResult.
We have implemented two levels in level setup, and have the written explanation and UML in the zip file.
